Purpose of a database
store data
provide an organizational structure for data
provide a mechanism for querying, creating, modifying, and deleting data

CRUD
Create
Read - querying
Update
Delete

Relational database -- display relationship/hierarchy

Problems with lists
Redundancy - duplicate entries in lists
Multiple themes - they could be created in other tables
List Modification issues - deletion, update, and insertion - lose a lot of data
--> such as deleting a single row also deletes other existing data

Relational databases stores information in tables. Each informational theme is stored in its own table.
Columns = different attributes of an entity
Rows = instances of the entity
Relational database will break-up a list into several parts or separate tables.

ex. employee table along with a department table with foreign keys

Putting tables together
Tables need to be joined back together -- join operation
--> tables are joined together using matched pairs of data values

Structured Query Language (SQL)
standard language for creating, processing, and querying databases and their tables
SQL retrieves, formats, reports, inserts, deletes, modify etc.

SQL Example
Use SQL to combine data in three tables to create a single table
SELECT Customer.customerLastName, Customer.customerFirstName, Customer.phone,
       Course.courseDate, Enrollment.amountPaid, Course.course, Course.fee
FROM   Customer, Enrollment, Course
WHERE  Customer.customerNumber = Enrollment.customerNumber
AND    Course.courseNumber = Enrollment.courseNumber;

Database Systems
Four components are:
Users
Database Application(s)
Database Management System (DBMS)
Datbase

Users <--> Database Application <--> DBMS <--> Database

Users
use a database application to keep track of information
use different user interface forms to enter, read, delete, and query data
produce reports

Database
Self-describing collection of related records
Self-describing:
database itself contains the definition of its structure
Metadata: data describing the structure of the data in the database
tables within a relational database are related to each in some way

Database Contents
user data
metadata
indexes and other overhead data
application metadata

DBMS
serves as an intermediary b/w database applications and the database
DBMS manages and controls database activities
DBMS creates, processes, and administers the databases it controls
DBMS IS NOT A DATABASE

Functions of a DBMS
create databases
create tables
create supporting structure
read database data
modify database data (insert, update, delete)
maintain database structures
enforce rules
control concurrency
provide security
perform data backup and recovery

Referential Integrity Constraints
DBMS can enforce many constraints
ensure that the values of a column in one table are valid based on the values in
another table
--> ex. A user must belong to an existing group in the user_groups table

Database Applications
set of one or more computer programs or websites that serve as an intermediary
between the user and the DBMS
--> Data Access Layer

Personal Database System
support one application
have only a few tables
simple in design
involve only one computer
support one user at a time

Enterprise-Level Database Systems
support several users simultaneously
support more than one application
involve multiple ocmputers
more complex in design
have many tables
have many databases
