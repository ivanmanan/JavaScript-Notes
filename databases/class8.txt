Increase in MPG  20%             66.7%

Bubba will enjoy more fuel savings per year than Daisy
--> reasoning is taking difference of current and new vehicle mileage

Business Intelligence Systems (BI)
assist managers and other professionals in the analysis of current and past activities and in the prediction of future events
do not directly support operational activities
support management assessment, analysis, planning, and control

Types of BI Systems
reporting systems - sort, filter, group, and make elementary calculations on operational data
data mining applications - perform sophisticated analyses on data; analyses that usually involve complex statistical and mathematical processing

Data Warehouse
a large store of data accumulated from a wide range of sources within a company and used to guide management decisions

Problems with Operational Data
dirty data - "V" as a gender code instead of "M" or "F"
garbage in --> garbage out
missing values
inconsistent data - data that have changed, such as a customer's phone number
nonintegrated data - data from two or more sources that need to be combined
incorrect format - time data stored as hours when needed in minutes
too much data - excessive number of columns

ETL Data Transformation
ETL = extract, transform, load
data commonly need to be "cleaned" before they can be added to a data warehouse
--> reconcile dirty, inconsistent, nonintegrated data, handle missing values, etc.
data commonly need to be transformed before they can be added to a data warehouse

Data Mart
a subset of an organization's data warehouse

Dimensional Databases
a non-normalized database structure used for data warehouses
may use slowly changing dimensions
values change infrequently - e.g. phone number, address
used to track historical data - contain a date or time dimension

Normalized Operational Database
fast data storage, slow data retrieval

Non-Normalized Data Warehouse
slow data storage, fast data retrieval

OLAP
OnLine Analytical Processing
a technique for dynamically examining database data
OLAP uses simple arithmetic functions such as Sum, Average, and Count

Data Mining
a mathematically sophisticated technique for analyzing database data
data mining uses math and statistics
--> not just simple functions, as with OLAP

Data Mining Techniques
1) cluster analysis
2) decision tree analysis
3) regression
4) neural networks
5) market basket analysis

1 exabyte = 1 million terabytes
many exabytes of new data every day

Big Data
refers to the rapidly expanding amount of data being stored and used by organizations
--> large and complex datasets, difficult to process using traditional database management tools or traditional data processing applications, much of this big data is being generated by Web 2.0 applications

Challenges to Big Data:
data capture, maintenance (curation), storage, search, transfer, analysis, visualization, etc.

NoSQL Movement
non-relational databases in order to support huge and highly distributed/highly replicated collections of data
--> NoSQL = "Not only SQL"
these databases are often referred to as structured storage
--> simpler designs than relational databases; looser consistency models than relational models
--> often do not provide ACID guarantees

Apache Cassandra - one of most popular structured storage database management systems
